Generally, there are three options to determine the media type of a request:

Using URL suffixes (extensions) in the request (eg .xml/.json)
Using URL parameter in the request (eg ?format=json)
Using Accept header in the request
By default, this is the order in which the Spring content negotiation manager will try to use these three strategies. And if none of these are enabled, we can specify a fallback to a default content type.
