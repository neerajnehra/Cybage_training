Article 14 says that every person should be treated equally. Our society comprises men and women. 
In earlier times, men were considered to be the leading members of a family and womens were assigned for household only.

Incident:

He knew who she was. The girl who had been sexually assaulted. She expected to be safe next to him.
But if your thinking is on that level then it doesn't matter what other person means to you. And who knows 
what was going on his mind. Even she didn't know. Once, he was sleeping with his mother and she felt like 
she could also sleep with them without harm/danger. But what happened that night after his mother fell asleep 
was something she could have ever imagined of. He tried on her forcefully, but she managed herself to get out of that 
situation immmediately. After that incident she could never trust him. She didn't expose him in front of
anyone. She was none other than his own sister.  
All that happened was a nightmare to her which she couldn't forget.
